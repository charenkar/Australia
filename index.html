<h2>Have you ever wanted to go on a vacation but you don&#39;t know where? Then Australia is the country for you!</h2>

<p>You could choose to spend months circling the country as you visit each state, or maybe just a couple of weeks concentrated on the eastern side of the country. You could even spend weeks on the island of Tasmania! You could spend three or four days road tripping along the coast within Melbourne and Sydney. This one is one of my favorite road trips so far. It is beautiful!</p>
